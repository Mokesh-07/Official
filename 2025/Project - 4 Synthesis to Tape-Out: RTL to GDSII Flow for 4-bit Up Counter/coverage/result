        Extracting FSMs for coverage:
                worklib.up_counter
                worklib.tb_up_counter
        Total FSMs extracted = 0
        Building instance overlay tables: .................... Done
        Enabling instrumentation for coverage types: block expression FSM toggle functional
ncelab: *W,COVDCL: By default expression coverage is scored only for Verilog logical operators (|| and &&) and VHDL logical operators (OR, AND, NOR, and NAND), and is scored only in condition expressions. To score coverage for other operators and for expressions in other statements, use the "set_expr_coverable_operators" and "set_expr_coverable_statements" coverage configuration file commands with suitable options at elaboration.
